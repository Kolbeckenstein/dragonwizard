# D&D 5th Edition Rules

## Character Creation

Creating a character involves several steps:

1. Choose a race
2. Choose a class
3. Roll ability scores
4. Describe your character

Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace. They live in places of ethereal beauty and have keen senses and intuition.

**Ability Score Increase**: Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

## Combat Rules

### Initiative

When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures.

### Attack Rolls

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers.

**Formula**: 1d20 + ability modifier + proficiency bonus + other modifiers

### Damage Rolls

Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target.
